## Overview
Discord_productbot is a discord bot that loads data from a json file and formats that data into an easier to understand format. Users would run a command in discord and data would be returned from the productbot. 

This was originally built for a blockchain game which had around 250 different components that came together to build other components. The productbot would return recipes for every product in the game including the quantities required for each product and the action required to build that product. 

It also included a custom formula which produced a weighted number for a product which was based on the complexity of crafting the sum of it's parts.
